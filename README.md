# Homework 8

**By:** Cole Nemec & Evan Sieden


Homework 8 time!

### Note:
```makefile``` will be the makefile for the entirety of this project, ```hw 7_makefile``` makes everything from the files associated with HW7.

#### On HW7:
The files associated with homework 7 - hforest.hh/.cc, test_hforest.cc, htree.hh/cc, test_htree.cc, and the HW7 makefile - were written by Taylor Blair and Cole Nemec. For this assignment, HForest needed to have a method, ```pop_tree()```, updated so that it "popped" the tree node with the lowest value, rather than the tree node with the highest value, as was done in HW7.

#### Additional Credits:
+ Taylor Blair - Assistance with designing an implementation of adaptive Huffman encoding
